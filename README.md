java cProject: Particle Filter-Based Robot Localization
November 12, 2023
Abstract
Based on the information from the ”Particle Filter” slides, here is a project idea for students
involving the implementation of a Particle Filter for localization and navigation using Python. The
project is designed to be straightforward enough for students with some programming experience,
yet challenging enough to provide a comprehensive understanding of Particle Filters in a practical
scenario.
1 Project Description
In this project, students will implement a Particle Filter to estimate the position of a robot moving in
a two-dimensional space. The robot’s environment will be represented as a grid, where each cell can
be either an obstacle or free space. The robot will have access to a simple sensor that provides noisy
measurements of its distance to the nearest obstacle in its front, left, right, and back directions.
1.1 Objectives
• Implement a Particle Filter: Students will develop a Particle Filter to estimate the robot’s
location based on sensor readings and a map of the environment.
• Simulate Robot Movement: Create a simulation where the robot moves a certain number of
steps in the environment, making random turns and moves.
• Sensor Data Simulation: Generate simulated sensor data based on the robot’s actual position
and the map.
• Visualization: Implement real-time visualization of the particle cloud and the estimated position
 of the robot in comparison to its actual position.
1.2 Implementation Approaches
Basic Python Implementation: - Use standard Python libraries (‘numpy‘, ‘matplotlib‘ for visualization).
 - Represent the map as a 2D array, the robot’s position as coordinates, and particles as
objects with position and weight attributes. - Implement particle resampling, motion update, and
measurement update functions.
Object-Oriented Approach: - Deffne classes for the Robot, Particle, and Map. - Implement
methods for movement, sensing, and updating in each class. - Use inheritance to showcase different
types of particles or robots, if desired.
Advanced Visualization with Pygame: - Utilize the ‘pygame‘ library for more interactive
and sophisticated visualization. - Allow real-time interaction, e.g., manually controlling the robot’s
movement or altering the environment.

Note:
• This code provides a basic framework and requires further development to fully simulate the
environment, sensor readings, and particle weight updates.
• The move and sense methods for the Robot and Particle classes should be tailored to the speciffc
problem and sensor model.
• The visualization updates the particles and robot position at each step, illustrating the working
of the particle fflter.
This implementation serves as a foundational guideline, and students are encouraged to build upon it,
reffning and adding complexity as needed for their speciffc project requirements.
3 Expected Outcomes
• - Understand the concept and application of Particle Filters in localization.
• - Gain experience in simulating robot movement and sensor readings.
• - Develop skills in probabilistic reasoning and algorithm implementation.
4 Evaluation Criteria
• - Accuracy of the localization (how close the estimated position is to the actual position).
• - Efffciency of the implementation (number of particles used vs. accuracy).
• - Quality of the visualization and ease of understanding the Particle Filter process.
This project provides a balance of theoretical understanding and practical application, making it
an excellent exercise for students to grasp the fundamentals of Particle Filters in robotics.
